% RBT - Rank-Based Transformation for Contrast Enhancement
%
%   img_RBT = RBT(img_input)
%
%   This function performs a rank-based transformation (RBT) on a grayscale
%   image by globally ranking all pixel intensities and mapping them
%   evenly across the dynamic range. The transformation is parameter-free
%   and does not consider intensity frequency or spatial context.
%
%   Input:
%     img_input - Input grayscale image (uint8, uint16, single, or double)
%
%   Output:
%     img_RBT   - Contrast-enhanced image with the same data type as input
%
%   The RBT algorithm is described in:
%     Chen, Cheng-Hui, and Torbj√∂rn EM Nordling.
%     "Rank-based Transformation Algorithm for Image Contrast Adjustment."

%
%   Notes:
%     - The output intensities are uniformly spaced between 0 and the
%       maximum value of the input data type (e.g., 255 for uint8).
